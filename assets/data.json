Some people say that they haven’t made anything worth listening to after Steelbath Suicide. Some have only heard Stabbing The Drama. Some think The Living Infinite was quite epic. It’s all good. At this point in a band’s career, you can either choose the nostalgia route, playing old albums in their entirety, because that makes an easy package for promoters to sell. And the music industry is a lot about selling these days. You can also choose to ignore reality, and do what you really want to do, and try to evolve and create something new and different. Because that’s the reason you started doing this in the first place, right? To make some sort of impression somewhere, to perhaps make someone feel a bit moved or confused or inspired, or just to create something that would keep resonating somewhere in the ether, perhaps to become an ignored aural wraith, but perhaps also to be remembered. Because there will always be another version of reality, and some of us will always try to find a way out of it. Hence the new album Verkligheten. Verkligheten is the Swedish word for reality, the entity that we’re all trying to escape from. Verkligheten is our attempt to try and go somewhere else, to express all those things that are born in between hypnagogic states and frenzies of hyperrealism. Verkligheten is the otherworldliness of Swedish suburban anxiety, accompanied by blastbeats and slide guitars.",

After a few lineup changes, making Christofer the only original member to remain, THERION released Theli, which would be the ultimate breakthrough for the band.

Dawson’s career with COVEN continued intermittently through the decades. She also worked in Hollywood and as a backup singer. But COVEN was always her passion and embodied much of how she viewed the world. Dawson has assembled a new COVEN lineup that will make their long anticipated live debut at Brutal Assault this week.

                    "bandDescription":"Doom Rock pioneers formed already back in 1976 by Scott Wino Weinrich (of Saint Vitus fame). THE OBSESSED was formed in the late 1970’s in Potomac, Maryland by legendary guitarist Scott “Wino” Wenrich (Saint Vitus/Spirit Caravan). The band spawned in the realm of musicians/artists such as Black Sabbath, Frank Zappa, The Dictators and The Stooges. The earliest lineup consisted of Wino, Mark Laue (Bass), John Reese (Guitars) and Dave Flood (Drums). In 1983, Wino took over vocals duties and the band became a 3-piece to record the Sodden Jackal EP. The band broke up in the late 80s after Wino moved to California to join Saint Vitus. At that time, a German label, Hellhound Records, and the booking agency that had signed Saint Vitus, released The Obsessed, originally recorded in 1985, prompting Wino to reform THE OBSESSED. After multiple lineup changes the band signed to Columbia Records in 1994 to release their third and final album, The Church Within. Despite highly acclaimed reviews, THE OBSESSED would breakup once again following the release, seeing Wino forming Spirit Caravan (Then Shine) and other projects. Wino announced the full-time return of THE OBSESSED in March 2016 and the band’s official signing to Relapse Records to record the follow up to The Church Within. The following year the band unleashed Sacred, their first studio album in over 20 years. With renewed energy and purpose, THE OBSESSED sounds heavier and more relevant than ever before. On Sacred, the band doubles down on enormous, heaving riffs and pummeling low-end across 12 tracks of eternal doom. Rounded out by Wino’s lyrical honesty and iconic throaty vocals, Sacred is an album that further pushes THE OBSESSED into the annals of heavy metal history, well worth the two-plus decade wait. The band will do a couple of gigs in Europe in 2019, so do not miss this opportunity!",

No matter if it is the scorching first single ‘Seismic Abyss’, the dynamic ‘Catastrophic Retribution’, ‘Parasitic Horrors’ or ‘Reanimating Pathogen’, SKELETAL REMAINS blend elements of death and thrash metal with blazing solos uniting influences from such a melodic master like James Murphy (Death, Cancer, Obituary, Testament) to the divebombing assault of Rick Rozz (Death, Massacre). The album is basically the next step up for us! It’s a bit more technical compared to our first two albums and we have also used seven string guitars for some songs to add a heavier edge at times, but overall it has the same sound and feeling of our previous releases: Old school death metal from the late 80s and early 90s with a little bit of our own taste added to it!

                    "bandDescription":"DISCHARGE is a British hardcore punk band formed in 1977, often considered among one of the very first bands to play hardcore punk. While the band had substantial lineup changes over its history, the core members over the early 1980s, when the band produced its key recordings, were Kelvin Cal Morris (vocals), Tony Bones Roberts (guitar), Roy Wainwright (bass), and Terry Roberts (drums). The band's music is characterized by a heavy, distorted, and grinding guitar-driven sound and rawly shouted vocals, with lyrics on anarchist and pacifist themes. The band's first album in 1982, Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing, was an instant classic defining the so called d-beat genre. In the early 1980s, the group did a number of singles and EPs like the famous 1981 EP Why or the 1982 single State Violence State Control. After 1982, the addition of guitarist Peter Pooch Purtill brought significant thrash metal crossover elements to the band. In the 1990s, the band released several metal-influenced albums, which alienated some of the original fan base. In the early 2000s, the original line up was reunited and they released a self-titled album using the 1980s musical style. DISCHARGE's music influenced hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, grindcore and various extreme metal subgenres.",

Now, with debut full lenght Come Ethereal Somberness, they shift into something hammering and hideous yet nevertheless invoke clarity that never castrates their attack.

For the entirety of their career, THE CONTORTIONIST has proven capable of being been equally at home on tour with Deftones, Periphery, or Between The Buried And Me, thanks to their dynamic combination of metal’s blunt precision with the adventurous spirit of prog-rock heroes like Rush and King Crimson. THE CONTORTIONIST integrates seemingly disparate worlds to create their own sound, with a focus on tone, vibe, color, and atmosphere. THE CONTORTIONIST ultimately prove to have as much in common with the psychedelic experimentation of later Opeth or Tool and even the textured melodicism of Sigur Ros as they do technical heavy music, but they’ve never sacrificed urgent impact. Critics and fans admire their intelligent approach to the crushing riffs of tech-metal, which becomes more vibrant with elements of ambitious post rock and jazzy / fusion-infused virtuosity.

They’ve continually evolved by placing hope in the future – from leaving the underground scene they were fundamental in establishing to continually mesmerising the world with stargazing post-progressive alternative rock that knows no borders. Led by brothers Daniel and Vincent Cavanagh, along with drummer John Douglas, singer Lee Douglas, bassist Jamie Cavanagh and keyboardist/drummer Daniel Cardoso – this is a band that have forsaken all notion of expectation – highly evocative music simply pours out of them. And in a world of plastic conformists so desperately awaiting their moment of recognition, it’s a potent truth very much needed… Their latest album The Optimist was one of the best albums of 2017 and yet again uphold the bands name, which is built on the most soul-baring and introspective forms of artistic expression. Rightfully so, ANATHEMA'S shooting star looks set to burn perpetually brighter and brighter.",

From the start, AGNOSTIC FRONT released a catalogue of fast and violent punk tunes consisting of distinctive and aggressive drumming, bass work, and a non-stop barrage of chaotic shouting. AGNOSTIC FRONT’s uncontrollable drumming and fuming guitars fill every minute like an onrushing storm of flailing limbs and incinerating transistors. The heavier paced balance between the energy and discipline of their earlier punk roots strikes a taut and vivid rock barrage that moshes in close formation. AGNOSTIC FRONT continues to be living embodiment that hardcore for life isn't an empty slogan or a musical dead end. No one is born with tattoos. No one's born hardcore. But when the ink or the music sets in, you're changed. Their latest offering reaffirms that AGNOSTIC FRONT as a band, still operates like a musical razor blade. Regardless of their history, the proof is simple: AGNOSTIC FRONT’s anthems are hard, cutting, and the remarkable music continues to broaden with every release. “We support UNITY! We despise ignorance and hatred within our scene. The only people we should be at war with is those who oppress us, not with each other. Unite! Fight the system! Not ourselves! Believe – Hardcore!",

                    "bandDescription":"A Tribute To Hellhammer HELLHAMMER existed for a mere two years, from May 1982 to May 1984. During this time, the band wrote material for three demos, one 12 EP, and the legendary Death Metal compilation album, along with a number of unrecorded songs. In light of HELLHAMMER's now mythically iconic status in the global metal scene, it is almost inconceivable that most of this music has never been performed life. HELLHAMMER's successor group, CELTIC FROST, formed by ex-HELLHAMMER members Tom Gabriel Warrior and Martin Eric Ain, initially played two of HELLHAMMER's songs but soon abandoned this habit due to the band rapidly developing its own material. Tom Gabriel Warrior's TRIPTYKON, founded in 2008, have played one or the other rare HELLHAMMER song during special occasions. The vast body of HELLHAMMER's work remains unperformed, however. Until now. The resurrection of the music of HELLHAMMER has been an idea Tom Gabriel Warrior and Martin Eric Ain have discussed for many years, sparked not least by their renewed collaboration in the reformed CELTIC FROST in the 2000s and by the years of work on Warrior's second book Only Death Is Real (2009), which details the history of HELLHAMMER and early CELTIC FROST. Tom Gabriel Warrior: Hellhammer will never return and will never be reformed. It is absolutely impossible to reform a band so closely linked to a very specific and unique period in time. I never considered it, no matter how substantial the offers that were pitched to me over the years. But Hellhammer's music exists, and it is an extremely important part of my life's path. And I would like to play it onstage before my demise. The first steps towards the realization of TRIUMPH OF DEATH, named after Hellhammer's most infamous song and intended to be a very respectful and authentic tribute to Hellhammer, were taken years ago. TRIUMPH OF DEATH consists of some of Warrior's closest friends; individuals who not only love this music but truly understand it. The line-up emulates Hellhammer's final incarnation of April/May 1984, when the group had added an additional guitarist. TRIUMPH OF DEATH will commence playing Hellhammer's music onstage in 2019. It is a an open-ended project, but the band will only play select concerts. Apart from considerations regarding the release of an occasional live EP, TRIUMPH OF DEATH will not record any new music but is solely dedicated to performing both well-known and obscure Hellhammer songs. The project is based in Zurich, Switzerland.",

GODFLESH has influences ranging from initially Swans, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and industrial music very much like Killing Joke, Throbbing Gristle and even some folk from Leonard Cohen. Their sound has been constantly evolving; at times, GODFLESH moved practically completely away from metal only to move back with the next release. All around, the industrial element always stuck with them.  They've been known to inspire countless bands ranging from Fear Factory, Danzig, Ministry, KoRn, Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, even the likes of the Beastie Boys...  GODFLESH is also known to highly inspire the post hardcore/sludge genre with such bands like Isis and Pelican playing a style akin to them, just minus the industrial elements (though they are highly inspired by the sound layering and atmosphere GODFLESH created). Justin Broadrick formed this group after walking out of Napalm Death and having stints in other bands. He formed the band with Ben GC Green, a partnership which is seen as being the definitive essence of GODFLESH.",

A distinctive, sublime mix of Chinese folk music and black metal, employing traditional instruments such as the guzheng, bamboo flute or the erhu and expertly merging them with guitar-led extremity, it creates a completely alien mood which nevertheless will still feel strangely welcoming and familiar. For Westerners, a clumsy but still apt metaphor to describe it might be as if Wolves In The Throne Room were thrown in the middle of a fight scene from any Zhang Yimou epic.",

Above all, it is human, and all that that entails. It's as sincere as we could make it. Those exposed to the ten tracks comprising the band's tenth full-length will be unable to deny the truth to these words, for lyrically, musically and sonically it is a punishing listen mired in darkness and seething with raw emotion. With multi-instrumentalist Mick Kenney pushing their distinctive hybrid of symphonic black metal, death metal, industrial and grindcore ever forward, Hunt draws lyrical inspiration primarily from the horrors of the First World War, contemporary politics, and the letters of D.H.

In 2007, the metal world got its wish as CARCASS reformed to play several sold-out reunion shows around the globe. Once again re-motivated to administer a shot of cynicism and infectious riffs into the arm of a sickly metal scene, founding members Bill Steer and Jeff Walker began writing what would become the latest output of their highly influential career, Surgical Steel. Only the choicest of cuts were made, and blood sweat and tears were shed to bring us a record worthy of the CARCASS legacy. In short, their latest Surgical Steel is just what the doctor ordered.",

Their sound is diverse with quiet instrumental jazz influenced sections and aggressive black metal blast beats and vocals. Ved Buens Ende means By the end of the bow referring to the mythological rainbow Bifröst. VED BUENS ENDE was formed in Oslo in 1994 by the drummer Carl-Michael Eide. They were signed to the British label Misanthropy Records. The band was unique by their mixture of many musical elements and Eide's crooning. Also, Eide's drumming was unusual in style, with very little repetition and a tendency to shy away from traditional drumming. For example, many of the blast beats on Written in Waters feature a highly active and non-repetitive left hand, which becomes a separate voice from the foot and right hand, often playing in a different meter than the other two. The band split up in 1997, after releasing only one full-length album Written in Waters. The album is unique and unusual. It incorporates many elements from various music forms, from usual Norwegian Black Metal (like at the end of Coiled in Wings) to jazz-inspired and dissonant riffs or folk-ish elements. Vocals on this album are mournful and sad by Carl-Michael Eide's crooning (accompanied by Kristine Stensrud) which makes a part of the album's uniqueness. As usual Eide's lyrics are rather unconventional and apparently deal with fantasy and dream. VBE will only do 4 shows in 2019 so do not miss this opportunity to see these pioneers of true avant-garde metal live!",
